# Product Category Classifier

This project builds a machine learning model that predicts a product category based on the product title.

## Goal
Automatically suggest the most likely `Category Label` for a new product using only the `Product Title`.

## Tech Stack
- Python
- pandas
- scikit-learn

## Project Structure (planned)
- `data/` – dataset (`products.csv`)
- `notebooks/` – analysis and experiments
- `model/` – saved trained model (`.pkl`)
- `train_model.py` – training script
- `predict_category.py` – interactive prediction script

## Status
Project initialized. Next step: add dataset and set up notebooks.
